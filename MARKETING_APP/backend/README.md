Réflexion durant 1m 11s
Nice — this is a great project idea. Below I’ll give you a practical, end-to-end MERN plan (backend → worker → frontend) using the What / Why / How pattern for each step so it’s easy to implement. I’ll also call out recommended libraries, sample code snippets, deployment notes, and legal/deliverability essentials you must consider.

Main architecture (high level):
React frontend ⇄ Express/Node API ⇄ MongoDB (data + job scheduler if you choose Agenda) + background worker(s) that perform sends (email via SendGrid / SMTP / Nodemailer; SMS via Twilio). Use a queue/scheduler (Agenda if you want Mongo-backed, or Bull/BullMQ + Redis for high scale). 
SendGrid

1) Product & data model (MVP first)
What
Define the minimum entities: User (merchant), Contacts, Segments/Lists, Templates, Campaigns, MessageLogs / Events, Suppression (unsubscribed), Billing/Quota.

Why
Clear models make the rest of the app (UI, scheduling, analytics, compliance) straightforward and consistent.

How (example Mongoose schemas)
js
Copier
Modifier
// models/Contact.js
const ContactSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  owner: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' },
  email: { type: String, index: true },
  phone: String,
  firstName: String,
  lastName: String,
  tags: [String],
  consent: { type: Boolean, default: false }, // opt-in metadata
  consentSource: String, // where/when they opted in
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
});
js
Copier
Modifier
// models/Campaign.js
const CampaignSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  owner: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' },
  name: String,
  type: { type: String, enum: ['email','sms','both'] },
  templateId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Template' },
  targetQuery: Object, // saved filter (e.g., tags, segment)
  scheduleAt: Date,
  status: { type: String, enum: ['draft','scheduled','running','completed','failed'] },
  metrics: { sent: Number, delivered: Number, opened: Number, clicked: Number },
  createdAt: Date
});
2) Pick your providers & queue tech
What
Choose an email provider (SendGrid / Mailgun / Amazon SES) and an SMS provider (Twilio, Vonage, etc.). Choose a background processing library (Mongo-backed Agenda or Redis-backed Bull/BullMQ).

Why
Providers give higher deliverability, analytics, webhooks; queue system prevents blocking requests and handles retries/throughput. Agenda stores jobs in Mongo (less infra if you're already using Mongo); Bull/BullMQ uses Redis and is better for very large scale/high throughput. 
SendGrid
Twilio
GitHub
docs.bullmq.io

How (recommendation)
Email: start with SendGrid for easy integration (+ dynamic templates, webhooks). Use SendGrid SDK @sendgrid/mail. 
SendGrid

SMS: Twilio is the standard and has excellent Node.js SDK and delivery docs. 
Twilio

Queue: If you want to avoid adding Redis, use Agenda (Mongo-backed). If you expect to scale to many workers and high throughput, use Bull/BullMQ + Redis. 
GitHub
docs.bullmq.io

3) Backend API & auth
What
REST (or GraphQL) endpoints for: auth, contacts import, templates, create campaign, schedule campaign, campaign status, webhooks (provider callbacks), logs.

Why
Separation keeps front-end simple and secure; webhooks let you capture delivery/open/click events.

How (sketch)
Use Express + Mongoose.

Auth: JWT + refresh tokens (or OAuth if you want). Protect endpoints and implement role-based rules (admin / merchant / user).

Example route to create + schedule a campaign:

js
Copier
Modifier
app.post('/api/campaigns', authMiddleware, async (req, res) => {
  const campaign = await Campaign.create({ owner: req.user.id, ...req.body });
  if (campaign.scheduleAt) {
    // schedule job in Agenda / Bull
    await agenda.schedule(campaign.scheduleAt, 'run-campaign', { campaignId: campaign._id });
  }
  res.json(campaign);
});
4) Worker / Delivery pipeline (background process)
What
A separate worker process consumes scheduled jobs and sends messages via provider SDKs, updates logs, retries failures, throttles to provider rate limits.

Why
Sending can be slow, prone to transient failures, and must obey rate limits — background workers and retries avoid blocking web requests and allow horizontal scaling.

How (Agenda worker + SendGrid + Twilio example)
Agenda: create a job run-campaign that loads campaign + contacts, renders templates, enqueues send-subjobs, and updates metrics. 
GitHub

Send email (SendGrid example):

js
Copier
Modifier
const sgMail = require('@sendgrid/mail');
sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);

await sgMail.send({
  to: contact.email,
  from: 'no-reply@yourapp.com',
  subject: renderSubject,
  html: renderedHtml
});
Send SMS (Twilio):

js
Copier
Modifier
const client = require('twilio')(process.env.TWILIO_SID, process.env.TWILIO_TOKEN);
await client.messages.create({ body: messageText, to: contact.phone, from: process.env.TWILIO_NUMBER });
Add idempotency and dedup logic (record attempts in MessageLog, skip if sent). Use exponential backoff for retries. 
SendGrid
Twilio

5) Templates & personalization
What
Store templates (HTML/text) with variables like {{firstName}}. Provide a WYSIWYG editor + preview.

Why
Personalization boosts open/click rates and engagement; templates enable re-use and A/B testing.

How
Use Handlebars or Mustache to render templates on the server (or client preview). Example:

js
Copier
Modifier
const Handlebars = require('handlebars');
const tpl = Handlebars.compile(template.html);
const html = tpl({ firstName: contact.firstName, productName: '...' });
Validate rendered output and test with sample contacts before full send.

6) Contacts, segmentation & import
What
CSV import/upload, deduplication, tag-based segmentation, suppression lists, per-contact consent metadata.

Why
Accurate targeting increases conversion and avoids legal issues and spam complaints.

How
Import via server endpoints that parse CSV (e.g., csv-parse), validate emails/phones, and upsert contacts.

Save consent, consentSource, consentAt fields to prove opt-in (GDPR/CNIL importance).

Implement exclusion logic: if(contact.unsubscribed || contact.inSuppression) skip.

7) Deliverability & legal (critical)
What
Implement SPF, DKIM, DMARC; support unsubscribe; store consent & opt-in logs; follow local rules (GDPR/CNIL in EU, CAN-SPAM in US).

Why
Without auth records and unsubscribe handling you risk being blocked by inbox providers or fined for illegal marketing. Proper measures improve inbox placement and avoid blacklists. 
mailgun.com
CNIL
gdpr-info.eu

How
Use your email provider’s domain authentication steps (DNS records for SPF/DKIM/DMARC). Providers have guides; follow them precisely. 
mailgun.com

Unsubscribe: every marketing email must include a clear unsubscribe link that updates your suppression list immediately. Track unsub requests and honor them. (CAN-SPAM requires opt-out and timely removal; GDPR requires lawful basis for processing). 
Federal Trade Commission
gdpr-info.eu

For SMS: store explicit opt-in and provide an opt-out mechanism (reply STOP) and process it immediately (CNIL / PECR guidance for EU/UK). 
CNIL
ico.org.uk

8) Webhooks & analytics
What
Connect and process provider webhooks (delivery, bounce, open, click, SMS status). Store events in MessageLog and surface metrics in dashboards.

Why
You need real-time feedback to measure campaign effectiveness and to react (remove hard bounces, pause bad campaigns).

How
Create secure webhook endpoints (verify signatures from SendGrid / Twilio).

Example: SendGrid’s event webhook gives bounces/opens/clicks; Twilio has status callbacks for SMS. Persist those events and update campaign metrics. 
SendGrid
Twilio

9) Frontend (React) — UX & key components
What
Admin dashboard, campaign builder (stepper: choose template → target → schedule → review → send), contact manager, template editor, reports.

Why
Good UX reduces mistakes (sending to wrong list), helps merchants create high-converting messages, and shows ROI.

How (component suggestions)
Pages: /dashboard, /contacts, /templates, /campaigns/:id, /reports.

Components: CampaignBuilder, TemplateEditor (use react-quill or TipTap for HTML), ContactImporter, ScheduleModal, PreviewPane.

Use Axios or fetch to call your API. Example create campaign:

js
Copier
Modifier
await axios.post('/api/campaigns', {
  name, type, templateId, targetQuery, scheduleAt
}, { headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer '+token }});
Implement client-side preview & test-send functionality (send to test addresses first).

10) Rate limiting, quotas & anti-abuse
What
Per-user rate limits, send quotas, daily caps, and monitoring for spammy behavior.

Why
Protect your platform from being used to spam (which would damage your providers’ reputation and get accounts suspended).

How
Enforce per-merchant quotas (e.g., max sends / day).

Use express-rate-limit for API endpoints and validate campaign recipients count against quotas before scheduling.

Audit logs and alerts for suspicious spikes.

11) Testing, staging & deliverability checks
What
Staging environment, use test inboxes (Mailtrap, Ethereal), send small seeds before large sends.

Why
Catch template rendering, deliverability issues, or broken links before hitting real customers.

How
Configure SendGrid/Twilio test keys and Mailtrap for email preview.

Run integration tests for worker flow and webhooks.

12) Deployment & scaling
What
Dockerize app and worker; use managed MongoDB; put workers behind an autoscaling group; use a separate deployment for worker(s).

Why
Separation of web/API and worker processes helps scale independently and handle background load.

How (quick notes)
Use Docker Compose in dev: api, worker, mongo, redis (if using Bull).

CI/CD: GitHub Actions → build, run tests, push images → deploy to ECS/AKS/GKE/Heroku.

Monitor: Prometheus / Grafana or provider logs + Sentry for errors.

13) MVP roadmap (practical)
What to build first (priority)
Auth + user onboarding + tenant model

Contact import & consent storage

Template editor + preview

One-click test send (single email / SMS)

Campaign creation + schedule + Agenda worker to send (small batch)

Webhooks for bounces/delivery + suppression list

Dashboard with basic metrics

Why
These let merchants create, test, send, and measure campaigns safely and legally.

How
Do each step end-to-end (frontend → API → worker) before adding more features (A/B, automation flows, billing).

14) Concrete code snippets (mini blueprints)
Express + Agenda setup (very short sketch):

js
Copier
Modifier
// worker.js
const Agenda = require('agenda');
const agenda = new Agenda({ mongo: mongoose.connection });

agenda.define('run-campaign', async job => {
  const { campaignId } = job.attrs.data;
  // load campaign, contacts, template, loop contacts and send via provider
});

(async function() {
  await agenda.start();
})();

Quick final notes (practical tips)
Store all consents and opt-in timestamps — you'll need them for GDPR/CNIL inquiries. 
CNIL

Use test accounts and send small batches to warm IPs before sending big catalogs. Email providers usually require domain authentication to scale.

Monitor costs — SMS is expensive; implement per-merchant billing/quotas.

Logs & replay — keep message logs and ability to replay failed messages (with safety checks).

If you want, I can do one of these next (pick one):

Draft full Mongoose models + example Express routes + worker file (Agenda) ready to drop into a project.

Create a simple React campaign-builder UI skeleton (components + API calls).

Produce a Docker Compose + deployment checklist for local → production.

Tell me which and I’ll produce code you can paste into your repo
